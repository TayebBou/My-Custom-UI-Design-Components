# Getting Started with My Custom UI Design Components

# LIVE HERE : https://my-custom-ui-design-components.web.app

My-Custom-UI-Design-Components is a react app with my custom UI atoms, molecules and organisms to reuse them in other ReactJS projects.
Technical stack : React JS / TypeScript / Atomic Design / JEST - RTL / Redux Toolkit / test coverage / CRA / CSS / Sass / ESLint.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

All screen size are handled, working in all browsers.

For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
