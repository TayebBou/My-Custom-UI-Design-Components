# Getting Started with My Custom UI Design Components

# LIVE HERE : https://

My-Custom-UI-Design-Components is a react app with my custom UI atoms, molecules and organisms to reuse them in other ReactJS projects.
Technical stack : React JS / TypeScript / Atomic Design / JEST - RTL / test coverage / CRA / CSS / ESLint.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn coverage`

Fetch the jest test coverage of the react app.
